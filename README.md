# 3D Object twister

This is a Python script that twists 3D objects by manipulating the `gcode` machine code.

# Usage

- Run twist.py,
- Enter the relative or full path of the object,
- Enter the start layer at which to start the twisting process,
- Enter the stop layer at which to stop the twisting process,
- Enter the twisting angle in degree,
- Enter the coordinates of the rotation axis.

## Notes

- Currently only objects with constant layer height are supported
- Twisting (rotation) axis is perpendicular to the printing bed.
- Use Python of version ^3.7.x
